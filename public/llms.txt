  - Best painting months: May-June and September

## Quick Answer: How Much Paint Do I Need?

**Formula:** `(Total Wall Area - Door/Window Area) × Number of Coats ÷ 400 = Gallons Needed`

**Example:** 12×14 ft room, 8 ft ceiling, 1 door, 2 windows, 2 coats:
- Wall area: 2 × (12 + 14) × 8 = 416 sq ft
- Deductions: 21 + 30 = 51 sq ft
- Net: 365 sq ft × 2 coats ÷ 400 = **2 gallons**
